{
	name: "party name",
	limit: "maximum hastags per day",
	startDate: "Timestamp from first requested date",
	endDate: "Timestamp from last requested date",
	minDate: "Timestamp from the earliest possible requestable hastag",
	maxDate: "Timestamp from the latest possible requsetable hashtag",

		weight: [],
		ratio: []
	}
}



/*
	Example for days
*/
	
	day1 is the same day as startDate
	dayN is the same day as endDate

	hashtags: [
		{text: "svpol"}, {text: "migpol"}, ..., {text:"almedalen"}
	]

	days: {
		weight: [[1, 5, 10, ..., 1], ..., [4, 5, 10, ..., 0]],
		ratio: [[0.3, 0.2, ..., 0.1], ..., [0.5, 0.2, ..., 0.00001]]
	}

	The index of a hash tag in hashtags is the same as the indexs for the corresponding weight and ratio for a certain day. I.e "svpol" had the weight 1 and ratio 0.3 the first day. The N:th day it had the weight 4 and ratio 0.5. "almedalen" was not among top 100 the N:th day and will therefore get weight 0 but the ratio will still be included.

	weight is a number between 1 and 10.


/*
	Example for requested days
*/
	requestedIntervall: {
		weight: [1, 5, 10, ..., 1],
		ratio: [0.3, 0.2, ..., 0.1]
	}
	
	This work as the same way as the example above but the values correspond to all the days in the requested time interval.
